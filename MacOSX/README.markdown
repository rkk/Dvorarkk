# Dvorarkk - Mac OS X
The backtick key "`" is handled differently in Mac OS X, depending on the type of
physical keyboard. For Apple keyboards with Danish layouts, the key below Escape
and left of 1 produces either a backtick or a tilde.  
I have not fully investigated this, so experiment with the two supplied layout files,
to see what fits your combination of hardware and software keyboards.


## Installation
Copy the layout file you want to use, to the directory `~/Library/Keyboard Layouts`, create
the directory if it does not exist.  
Log out and in  to load the layout.
