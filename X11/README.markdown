# Dvorarkk - X11
For X11, a `xmodmap` mapping file is available, based on the default US Dvorak
layout with subsequent modification.


## Installation
The xmodmap file can be put anywhere in the filesystem. Run the command `xmodmap PATH/TO/dvorarkk.xmodmap` to
activate the layout in the current X11 session.
