# Changelog
All notable changes are documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

Note: Prior to version 1.0.0, a single digit version scheme was used,
to allow multiple different versions installed at the same time, especially
on Windows.
This really never worked, so Semantic Versioning is introduced instead.

## Version 1.2.0
Service release with minor changes,

  - Colon moved to the key to the right of Tab, quote (") now requires Shift to be pressed.
  - Accented e (é) added to e, requires Shift to be pressed.
  - Ntilde (ñ) added to n, requires Shift to be pressed.
  - Odiaeresis (ö) added to q, requires Alt to be pressed.
  - Apostrophe ('), grave (`) moved to the key to the right of Left Shift.

## Version 1.1.0
Service release with minor changes,

  - Semicolon (;) moved to a more ergonomic location on the key "6".
  - Circumflexe (^) now requires the Alt key to be pressed.
  - Umlaut (ü) added to "u" using the Alt key.
  - The sharp s (ß) added to "s", using the Alt key.


## Version 1.0.0
First SemVer-release, no functional changes compared to prior non-SemVer
version, see commit b27653916101c8d540e1ab8a1baedf3b5797e997.
However, Mac OS X and Windows are no longer supported as I neither use
nor have access to these anymore. Layout files for Mac OS X are moved
to the directory "Unsupported" and the README has been updated
to reflect this.
