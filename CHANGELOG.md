# Changelog
All notable changes are documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

Note: Prior to version 1.0.0, a single digit version scheme was used,
to allow multiple different versions installed at the same time, especially
on Windows.
This really never worked, so Semantic Versioning is introduced instead.


## Version 1.0.0
First SemVer-release, no functional changes compared to prior non-SemVer
version, see commit b27653916101c8d540e1ab8a1baedf3b5797e997.
However, Mac OS X and Windows are no longer supported as I neither use
nor have access to these anymore. Layout files for Mac OS X are moved
to the directory "Unsupported" and the README has been updated
to reflect this.
